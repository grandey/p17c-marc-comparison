** Purpose
Configure and analyse [[http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/][CESM]] simulations in order to compare /MARC/ (the /Modal Two-Moment Mixing-State-Resolving Aerosol Model for Radiation and Climate/) and [[http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/709/2012/][MAM]].

*** Still to-do
***** TODO Design and check configuration (in =configure_simulations.org=) of *comparison* simulations
***** TODO Submit *comparison* simulations
***** TODO Design and finalize =user_nl_cam= files for *timing* simulations
***** TODO Design and finalize configuration (in =configure_simulations.org=) of *timing* simulations
***** TODO Submit *timing* simulations

** Experimental design

*** Comparison simulations
In order to compare MARC, MAM3, and MAM7, five prescribed-SST simulations will be performed:
| Casename         | Aerosol model | Aersosol (and precursor) emissions |
|------------------+---------------+------------------------------------|
| =p17c_marc_2000= | MARC          | year-2000                          |
| =p17c_marc_1850= | MARC          | year-1850                          |
| =p17c_mam3_2000= | MAM3          | year-2000                          |
| =p17c_mam3_1850= | MAM3          | year-1850                          |
| =p17c_mam7_2000= | MAM7          | year-2000                          |

The year-2000 emissions simulations will facilitate comparison of aerosol fields, and also cloud microphysical and macrophysical fields. The year-1850 simulations will facilitate calculation of radiative flux perturbations (RFPs).

The simulations will be configured as follows:
1. *CESM 1.2.2.1* will be used. (This is CESM 1.2.2 configured to run on Cheyenne.)
2. MARC commit *ff48dbe* will be used.
3. Greenhouse gas concentrations and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) will be prescribed using *year-2000 climatological values*, based on the =F_2000_CAM5= (=FC5=) component set.
4. For the MARC and MAM3 simulations, the *RFP components* will be diagnosed following [[http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/9971/2013/][Ghan (2013)]]. The "online" radiation call will include aerosol-radiation interactions; the "offline" diagnostic radiation call will calculate "clean-sky" fluxes.
5. The *COSP* satellite simulator package will be activated.
6. A resolution of *f19_g16* will be specified.
7. Each simulation will be run for *32 years*, and the first two years will be excluded as spin-up. (Nudgding will not be performed.)
8. The simulations will be performed on *Cheyenne*, using 720 processors (20 nodes).

*** Timing simulations
In order to facilitate comparison of computational performance, several timing simulations will be performed:
| Casename         | Aerosol model | Radiation   | Notes                         |
|------------------+---------------+-------------+-------------------------------|
| =p17c_t_marc_r2= | MARC          | Double call | Standard MARC                 |
| =p17c_t_marc_r1= | MARC          | Single call | Modified radiation.F90        |
| =p17c_t_mam3_r2= | MAM3          | Double call | =rad_diag_1= in =user_nl_cam= |
| =p17c_t_mam3_r1= | MAM3          | Single call | Standard MAM3                 |
| =p17c_t_mam7_r2= | MAM7          | Double call | =rad_diag_1= in =user_nl_cam= |
| =p17c_t_mam7_r1= | MAM7          | Single call | Standard MAM7                 |

The simulations will be configured similarly to the comparison simulations described above, albeit with the following differences:
1. COSP will *not* be used.
2. "*20-day* model runs with *restarts and history turned off*" will be used, following the recommendations in the [[http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/cesm/doc/usersguide/x1516.html][CESM User's Guide.]]
3. For each case, *five runs* will be performed in order to assess variability.
4. For consistency, all cases will be submitted *on the same day*.
