** Purpose
Configure and analyse [[http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/][CESM]] simulations in order to compare /MARC/ (the /Modal Two-Moment Mixing-State-Resolving Aerosol Model for Radiation and Climate/) and [[http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/709/2012/][MAM]].

** Status

*** Completed
***** DONE Design and check =user_nl_cam= files for comparison simulations
CLOSED: [2017-07-21 Fri 11:48]
***** DONE Reproduce MARC emissions files using scripts in =p17c_input_data/= and check input data
CLOSED: [2017-07-21 Fri 14:34]
***** DONE Design and check configuration (in =configure_comparison_simulations.org=) of comparison simulations
CLOSED: [2017-07-21 Fri 14:35]
***** DONE Create and submit comparison simulations
CLOSED: [2017-07-21 Fri 14:47]
